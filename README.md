# quote-of-the-day

Little dapp based on Ethereum and IPFS that allows users to store a quote.
Users need Metamask to be able to change the quote.
The quote is stored on IPFS and its CID is stored on the Ethereum Blockchain.

Project is a based on this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTZVoqBUjvI&t=1s by Gregory McCubbin (https://github.com/gwmccubbin) 

Further developments: 
- refactored react-app to use functional components and hooks instead of class components and lifecycle methods.
- refactored use of ipfs-http-client.
- instead of memes users can store quotes.
